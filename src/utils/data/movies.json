Una mujer loca que vive en la isla había muerto a la hora exacta de las 23:59, y se cree que su espíritu había vuelto a perseguir a los soldados a la misma hora.

He is aided in his mission by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a human who has been helping Blade since he was a child. The film was a commercial success and grossed over $131 million worldwide. It was praised for its action sequences and Snipes’ performance as Blade.

En habitaciones parecidas hay más niños: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris y Avery Dixon, entre otros, que comparten capacidades especiales como la telequinesia o la telepatía. Todos ellos se alojan en la Mitad Delantera de la institución. Los mayores, en cambio, se encuentran en la Mitad Trasera. Como dice Kalisha: \"El que entra no sale\". La señora Sigsby, la directora, y el resto del personal se dedican a aprovecharse sin compasión del talento paranormal de los chicos. Si te portas bien, te premian. Si no, el castigo es brutal. Luke se da cuenta de que las víctimas van desapareciendo y son trasladadas a la Mitad Trasera, así que se obsesiona con huir y pedir ayuda. Pero nunca nadie ha escapado del Instituto... Deudora de Ojos de fuego y con personajes juveniles (como en It y en Stand By Me) con los que podemos empatizar, El Instituto nos recuerda de inmediato al mejor King, incluso aunque trate temas tan oscuros como los que copan los titulares hoy en día y que nos hacen temer por nuestro futuro",

When he tries to destroy them, something happens to him and he is burnt to death trapped in a shed. During the funeral, Jessie meets her high-school friend Preston Sanders (Mark Webber), who is unhappily married. Preston decides to help Jessie after watching the videotapes.

There he meets a young doctor, Sarah and soon realizes there is an air of gloom that envelops the entire site.

    "sinopsis": "In 1972, a scale of measurement was established for alien encounters. When a UFO is sighted, it is called an encounter of the first kind. When evidence is collected, it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with extraterrestrials, it is the third kind. The next level, abduction, is the fourth kind. Modern-day, Alaska, where-mysteriously since the 1960s-a disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations of the region, the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region, psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses. Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details, the validity of which is investigated throughout the film.",
